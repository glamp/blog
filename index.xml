      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re like me then you might have initially shyed away from using the psql shell. It&amp;rsquo;s nothing to be ashamed of, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit intimidating and not the most intuitive way to execute queries. Over time I&amp;rsquo;ve actually come to enjoy using it. And while I don&amp;rsquo;t neccessarily find myself using it everyday, there are some super handy commands I routinely use that I feel are worth passing on!</description>

Well fret no more because I&amp;rsquo;m about to show you how to calculate and &amp;ldquo;plot&amp;rdquo; a histogram from within Postgres.</description>
